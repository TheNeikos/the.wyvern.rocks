# The Wyvern Rocks

The Wyvern Rocks is a mythical place out in the ocean, only accessible by flight
and magic. One such Magical Device is the Browser you are seeing this with, so
open a new tab and check out

## Code

The `master` branch is supposed to *always* pass all tests. This is currently
done with the help of the awesome [Homu ![Homu](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10212162?v=3&s=16)](https://github.com/homu). She makes
sure that every pull request builds *just before it is merged*, meaning that
there cannot be a second pull request putting itself inbetween the code of the
to be merged Pull Request and others, thus we should get an evergreen `master`!

As an additional feature, only she can actually merge PRs. This rule may be
overriden should the situation arise (critical security error, etc..).
